                <p>Born to an elf woman and a human man named Aldrick Rin in a small village outside of Waterdeep, Eryn was raised by his grandparents following the disappearance of his mother and untimely death of Aldrick. Resentful of his elven heritage, his grandparents put Eryn to work from a young age, where he discovered a talent for music.</p>
                <p>As a teenager, Eryn's magical talents began to manifest as well as a talent for speech and slight of hand. Eryn wound up in trouble more often than not due to a penchant for stealing from those more well off than him to survive - all at the behest of his grandparents. Eryn saw little of his ill-gotten gains until finally he decided to flee the village for the bustling metropolis of Waterdeep.</p>

                <p>Eryn quickly established himself as a musician within the city, while maintaing his side buisness of scamming, stealing, and conning gullable nobles without much care. Scrapes with the law were common but through guile, wit, and a little bit of luck, Eryn avoided the dungeons.</p>
                <p>Everything changed for Eryn when he pulled off his greatest con to date, completely ruining a lesser noble and forcing him to leave the city without a gold to his name in disgrace. It was only after that Eryn discovered the noble's secret: he was singlehandedly funding several orphanages in the city at great cost to himself. With the source of gold gone the orphanages would close - and Eryn himself was robbed and lost everything he gained. Unable to fix his mistake, Eryn set out to use all his skills to try to keep the orphanages afloat. Our story begins with Eryn seeing a job posting from a bounty hunting firm. Feeling like adventure, Eryn responded to the posting on a lark and heads to a meeting at The Yawning Portal with a tiefling known only as Red.</p>
